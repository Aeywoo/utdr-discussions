<div align="center"><h1>üì∞ Discourse</h1></div>

**Discourse** is an in-development MediaWiki extension that acts as a compatibility layer between Discourse and MediaWiki. It is unstable for production use outside of the Undertale Wiki and Deltarune Wiki environment.

## Features
- Adds a social Discourse profile element to the top of every user page with avatars and edit count and posts count.
- Also links to every persons user page with links to `Special:Contributions`, `User_talk` page and a page of their Discourse posts.
- Allows every wiki user to have a Discourse account without the need to create one through Discourse.
- Has the option to combine user groups from Discourse and MediaWiki together, eliminating the need to manually promote staff members through Discourse and MediaWiki.
